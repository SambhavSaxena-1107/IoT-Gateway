# IoT-Gateway
The IoT Gateway is a device that can connect to different sensors used in industries,  agriculture, healthcare, and home automation. It can collect data from these sensors and  send it to a central server or a cloud platform. This allows us to keep track of what's  happening remotely. IoT Gateways acts as a bridge, that connects the sensor networks/devices to the Cloud IoT platform. Gateways provide a secure, managed connection between the devices and the network. They collect data from multiple IoT devices and aggregate it before sending it to the Cloud or Central Network.
